### Hi, I'm Utkir Kurbanov <img src="https://media4.giphy.com/media/gM5qFksULw54NMWyry/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47z6zgb4zcspq5m5lr3zt80veo2qhyzlfvn4oqotm1&rid=giphy.gif&ct=s" width="30px">

I have been studying programming for 2 years, during these years I have encouraged my programming skills such as HTML and CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript with its libraries, PHP and MySql. <br />

"If you're even a little bit good, you know you can be better." -----Lindsey Buckingham----- After 2 years of study, I am ready to practice, as Zig Ziglar said: “There is no elevator to success, you need to climb the stairs.” <br />
